# foodieventure-ux-design
For our 2-month long UX Design project at USF, a team of two peers and I decided to improve the user food decision-making process while exploring the connection between food and mood.

This GitHub repository is home to the 1) sample app frames presented in the final report, 2) initial user + task + conceptual analyses, 3) initial usability test, 4) final report.

The dynamic prototype of our first UX design project can be viewed on: https://www.figma.com/proto/5Uui67JF74x0CCsGz5jbdd/Lab-4-Prototype?node-id=14%3A349&scaling=min-zoom.
